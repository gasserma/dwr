# Why?

I built this site because I found the existing literature on retirement withdrawals (websites, papers, etc) to be lacking.
Particularly, the statistics presented in those sources are woefully underwhelming, and have trouble representing any sort of reality.
The problem how long one's nest egg will last is important and nuanced.
There is no unified set of metrics for assessing the quality of a retirement plan.

Simple metrics, like success rate, fall catastrophically short for certain withdrawal strategies.
For example, a strategy in which you withdraw 99% of your portfolio every year, will succeed by traditional meanings of success.
But in a few short years, you will have a nest egg worth merely a dime.

Rather than create a better set of metrics, this site attempts to provide the whole picture.
Graphically represented, simple and intuitive to understand, visually pleasing and engaging.

I want people to be able to compare strategies and *see* the difference.

I want people to easily be able to compose strategies, and again see what difference it makes.
Some of the most interesting strategies (Hebeler autopilot and VPW, for example) hint that choosing pieces of different strategies is a good idea.
They miss the mark, though.
You can combine and diversify withdrawal strategies in a myriad of ways, and doing so within a single strategy is prohibitive.
This tool allows you to compose them ad infinitum.
Diversification is hardly a novel idea in personal finance, but for some reason, no one seems to be exploring its effect in the withdrawl realm of retirement.
This tool lets you do that.

All that said, the prior art in this space is inspiring. The work of [cFIREsim](www.cFIREsim.com) was especially influential in this work.
